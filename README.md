# Text_Summarisation

A Text Summarisation model trained on News summary Data

- Developed an ML and NLP-based Text-Summarisation model using the seq2seq technique.
- Using one of the biggest NewsSummary Datasets available on well-known sources.
- Used NLP techniques like spacy and tokenization using NLTK to preprocess and clean the data for actual computation.
- The Model is a seq2seq model as an encoder-decoder architecture using LSTM cells.
