# Text_Summarisation

A Text Summarisation model trained on News Data

Developed a ML and NLP-based Text-Summarisation seq2seq model. Using one of the biggest NewsSummary Datasets available on the well-known sources. Used NLP techniques like spacy and tokenization using NLTK to preprocess and clean the data for actual computation. The Model is a seq2seq model as an encoder-decoder architecture using LSTM cells.
